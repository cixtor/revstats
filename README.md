### Revision Control Statistics

GitHub introduced a calendar with the contributions associated to each user account [1] back in 2013. The contributions calendar shows how frequently you've been contributing over the past year. However, this only applies to contributions to public repositories hosted on GitHub, and as of May 19, 2016 they allowed private repositories too [2]. This also makes it easier to see what others are working on in your Organization. Any repositories you have in common with the profile you're viewing are shown in this list.

[2] https://github.com/blog/2173-more-contributions-on-your-profile

But what about your contributions in private projects hosted in other services? This project aims to allow people to see their contributions int he same format as GitHub pointing the script to the directories where the private repositories reside in your computer's disk.

### Public Non-Code Contributions

GitHub not only counts the number commits and pull-requests but also when you open an issue. If you are using this tool offline it is be a good idea to include references to public issues that you have open so far.
